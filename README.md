Hi, I'm ,
MOHAMMED AADHIL

I am skilled in HTML and have created my portfolio website using HTML and basic CSS.
Currently, I’m learning Python programming to expand my technical capabilities.
I’ve also completed courses in Production Management and Fundamentals of Digital Marketing, which have deepened my understanding of various business functions.

Outside of academics, I enjoy watching movies, reading, and traveling to explore new cultures and perspectives.
My short-term goal is to secure a role in a reputable company where I can contribute my skills and grow professionally.
Long-term, I aspire to advance within the organization and make a meaningful impact through my work.
